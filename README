This program downloads the whole webcomic archive from usefriendly.org, including nag strips etc.
Use in case you (like me) want to keep a local copy in case the site goes down or whatever.

NOTA BENE: J.D. Frazer aka Illiad, the author of UserFriendly, says in the FAQ that he is firmly
opposed to using such programs and even threatens legal action and ban (if you're a paying
member). Consult your lawyer if you need to before actually using this program to verify if
it indeed constitutes a copyright infringement or it is a case of fair use.

P.S. Illiad - best of luck in your personal affairs and good health to you and your relatives.
