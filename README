= ABOUT =
This program downloads the whole webcomic archive from usefriendly.org, including nag strips etc.
Use in case you (like me) want to keep a local copy in case the site goes down or whatever.

Note that J.D. Frazer aka Illiad, the author of UserFriendly, says in the FAQ (quoted below)
that he is firmly opposed (or may be not, read it and decide for yourself) to using such programs
and even threatens legal action. Consult your lawyer if you need to before actually using
this program to verify if it indeed constitutes a copyright infringement or it is a case of fair use.


= QUOTE FROM http://www.userfriendly.org/faq/ =
Q. Is it okay if I 'webscrape' or pull down the comic with a script?
A. Such programs that allow a user to view comics owned by User Friendly.Org are unauthorized; 
and such activities constitute copyright infringement, unfair competition and trademark 
infringement, rendering the owner and/or user of such programs liable for damages. In short, no.

Q. What if I'm a paid member?
A. The answer is still no -- unless the only thing you do is pull down the current strip. No
going back into the archives and hammering the server. Doing that will get you blackholed,
paying member or not. If you aren't a paid member and you pull down the current strip please
pull down the ads as well. The concept here is that of a two-way street.

= TODO =
I still haven't figured out how to write a Python scraper for Google AdSense ads as requested
by Illiad. Any help would be welcome.


= P.S. =
Illiad - best of luck in your personal affairs and good health to you and your relatives.
And I do hope that quoting the FAQ doesn't constitute a copyright infringement, hmph.
